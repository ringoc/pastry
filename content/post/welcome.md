Meet Minty, the charming and affectionate 9-month-old Cavoodle who has stolen hearts with every wag of his tail and tilt of his head. With his soft, wavy coat resembling the hue of fresh mint leaves, Minty is not only a canine companion but a true member of the family. His endearing eyes twinkle with boundless curiosity, a window to a world filled with wonder and playfulness. 

Minty resides in the picturesque town of Berowra, where he embarks on adventures that match the beauty of his surroundings. His delightful personality shines through his every action, from his joyful leaps during playtime to his gentle nuzzles when seeking affection. As a Cavoodle, he embodies the perfect blend of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel's warmth and the Poodle's intelligence, making him not just a pet, but a loyal friend who brings joy and comfort to all fortunate enough to cross his path.
